SQL Queries:
 Consider the given Database Schema: 
The "Customers" table contains information about the company's customers, including their 
customer ID, name, email, and country.
The "Orders" table contains information about the orders made by the customers. Each order has 
an order ID, customer ID (which corresponds to the customer who made the order), order date, 
and total order amount.

Below is the SQL code to create the Customers and Orders tables according to the provided schema. After that, I’ll include the queries to answer each question.

### Step 1: Create Tables

sql
-- Create Customers Table
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    country VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create Orders Table
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    total_order_amount DECIMAL(15, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);


### Step 2: Sample Data Insertion (Optional)

You can insert sample data into the tables to test the queries.

sql
-- Insert sample data into Customers
INSERT INTO Customers (customer_id, name, email, country) VALUES
(1, 'Sam', 'sam@example.com', 'India'),
(2, 'Sara', 'sara@example.com', 'USA'),
(3, 'Steve', 'steve@example.com', 'India'),
(4, 'Sophia', 'sophia@example.com', 'UK');

-- Insert sample data into Orders
INSERT INTO Orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_order_amount) VALUES
(101, 1, '2022-01-05', 120000.00),
(102, 2, '2022-01-15', 95000.00),
(103, 1, '2022-01-25', 105000.00),
(104, 3, '2022-02-05', 60000.00),
(105, 4, '2022-01-20', 115000.00);


### Step 3: Queries for Each Requirement

1. *Find Order IDs Having Total Order Amount More Than 100000*

    sql
    SELECT order_id
    FROM Orders
    WHERE total_order_amount > 100000;
    

2. *Count the Number of Customers from India*

    sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS customer_count
    FROM Customers
    WHERE country = 'India';
    

3. *Find All Orders Made in January 2022*

    sql
    SELECT *
    FROM Orders
    WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-01-31';
    

4. *Display All Customers' Names Starting with ‘S’*

    sql
    SELECT name
    FROM Customers
    WHERE name LIKE 'S%';
    

5. *Count of Orders Placed by Each Customer (Customer Name, Email, and Order Count)*

    sql
    SELECT Customers.name, Customers.email, COUNT(Orders.order_id) AS order_count
    FROM Customers
    JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id
    GROUP BY Customers.name, Customers.email;
    

6. *Total Revenue Generated by Each Country*

    sql
    SELECT Customers.country, SUM(Orders.total_order_amount) AS total_revenue
    FROM Customers
    JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id
    GROUP BY Customers.country;
